MAZE ALGORITHM - IDEAL

// UPDATING GRAPH
Read LRF sensors
Update graph based on LRF data (disconnect node connections if there is a wall)

IF there is a package detected by color AND it is on a wall nearby:
	Acknowledge package with long LED
	deploy_package = true
IF there is a package detected by heat AND it is on a wall nearby:
	Acknowledge package with short LED
	deploy_package = true
IF deploy_package:
	deploy package


// FINDING NEXT NODE

// MOVING TO NEW NODE
Move to next node
WHILE moving:
	Apply angular and positional correctional (Replace meme code with PID - ASK MATT)
	IF black is detected:
		STOP movement
		Move back to center of previous tile
		Mark black tile node as B (Disconnect all surrounding nodes)



NODE TYPES:
N - Normal
B - Black (Treated like a walled box)
V - Victim (Treated like N for traversal purposes)
C - Checkpoint (Treat like N for 2018)
T - Transitional (from first to second floor and vice versa)
